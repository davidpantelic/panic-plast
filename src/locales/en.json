Resistant to impacts, aggressive chemicals, suitable for burying partially or completely, and as such represent an ideal and long-term investment. They are practical, easy to manipulate and install, and they guarantee waterproofness and a long-lasting solution, because the material loses only 5% of its properties after 50 years of use. Any plastic product can be fitted with various accessories such as valves, faucets, level indicators, external or internal threaded connections, overflows, inspection openings, chokes, anchoring feet, climbing frames and everything else according to your needs. /nYou can find more details on the Products page, where all our products are presented.",
